description: Read-only OpenSubtitles skill to search and download subtitles via API, then extract scene context by timestamp to avoid spoilers. Use when the user asks “what’s happening at this timestamp” or needs subtitle context; pairs well with Trakt for playback progress. Requires an OpenSubtitles API key and User-Agent.

# OpenSubtitles (Read-only)

Use this skill to fetch subtitle context around a timestamp. This is **read‑only**: no uploads or modifications.

## Setup

Users should obtain an API key at: https://www.opensubtitles.com/consumers

Required env vars:
- `OPENSUBTITLES_API_KEY`
- `OPENSUBTITLES_USER_AGENT` (e.g., `OpenClaw 1.0`)

Optional (for downloads):
- `OPENSUBTITLES_USERNAME`
- `OPENSUBTITLES_PASSWORD`
- `OPENSUBTITLES_TOKEN` (if already logged in)
- `OPENSUBTITLES_BASE_URL` (hostname from login response, e.g., `api.opensubtitles.com`)

## Commands

Scripts live in `{baseDir}/scripts/`.

### Search subtitles

```
{baseDir}/scripts/opensubtitles-api.sh search --query "Show Name" --season 3 --episode 5 --languages en
```

Prefer IDs when available (imdb/tmdb). Use parent IDs for TV episodes. Follow redirects for search (script already uses `-L`).

### Login (token)

```
{baseDir}/scripts/opensubtitles-api.sh login
```

Note: Login is rate limited (1/sec, 10/min, 30/hour). If you get 401, stop retrying.
Use `base_url` from the response as `OPENSUBTITLES_BASE_URL` for subsequent requests.

### Request a download link

Before downloading, check the local subtitle cache (see below). Only call the download API if the file is not already cached.

```
OPENSUBTITLES_TOKEN=... {baseDir}/scripts/opensubtitles-api.sh download-link --file-id 123
```

### Extract context at timestamp

After downloading an `.srt` file (default window: 10 minutes before timestamp):

On Windows, use `findstr` or PowerShell `Select-String` to replicate the awk logic (use the shell script as a guide). The agent should pick the best option available on that system.

```
{baseDir}/scripts/subtitle-context.sh ./subtitle.srt 00:12:34,500
```

Custom window:

```
{baseDir}/scripts/subtitle-context.sh ./subtitle.srt 00:12:34,500 --window-mins 5
```

## Trakt synergy

Pair with `trakt-readonly` to identify current episode; when Trakt adds playback progress support, update the Trakt skill to supply a precise timestamp for context‑aware, spoiler‑safe responses.

## Cache

Store downloaded subtitles under `{baseDir}/storage/subtitles/` (create if missing). Use a stable filename like:

`{baseDir}/storage/subtitles/<file_id>__<language>.srt`

Check this cache before calling `/download` to avoid wasting limited daily downloads.

## Guardrails

- Never log or expose API keys, passwords, or tokens.
- Only call `https://api.opensubtitles.com/api/v1` (or the `base_url` returned by login).
- Do not cache download links.
- Prefer IDs over fuzzy queries for accuracy.
- **Avoid wasting downloads:** store downloaded subtitle files locally and check the cache before calling the download API again.
- If a download is requested, always append the remaining download quota (from the `remaining` field) in the user response.
- Subtitle context should include the window from 10 minutes before the timestamp to the timestamp (default), unless the user specifies otherwise.
- The agent can adjust `--window-mins` to get more or less context as needed.
